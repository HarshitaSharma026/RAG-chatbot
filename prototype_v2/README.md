# RAG Chatbot – Prototype V2 (Advanced Techniques)

This version introduces **advanced RAG techniques** to improve the accuracy of context retrieval and, ultimately, the answers generated by the chatbot.

## 🧠 What’s New?

RAG allows custom data integration into a chatbot, but naive retrieval often misses relevant information due to:
- Keyword mismatch in user queries
- Ambiguous context
- Poor ranking of retrieved chunks

To address these, Prototype V2 introduces:
- ✍️ **Query Rewriting**: Each user query is rewritten into multiple forms to overcome keyword mismatch.
- 📊 **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**: Combines multiple retrieval outputs for robust, ranked context.
- 💬 **Few-Shot Prompting**: Carefully crafted examples guide the language model to produce better answers.

These techniques are chosen to **keep the chatbot lightweight** while maximizing response accuracy — inspired by ideas from the **DeepSeek R1 paper**, which showed how simple design choices (vs. heavy RL-based methods) can lead to strong performance.

## 📖 Learn the Design
